# Python-SOLID Exercise

## Make a Python program with the following requirements:

- Do it without using any __ main __ function or global code. Every test and instance of the program it will be using Pytest with TDD approach.
- You must use SOLID principles in all your code (Single responsability, Open for extension/Closed for modification, Liskov Principle, Interface Segregation and Dependecy Injection).
- You must use Composition over Inheritance principle.
- Create an app of a Fast Food Restaurant that contains the following:
  - Must allow any number of meal (At least two like: Pizza and burger), every type of meal must allow any subtype of it (At least 2 of each one, ex: Hawaiian pizza, Arrachera burger).
  - Deliver a ticket with the count of every dish, date, prices and total.
  - It must allow any type of tickets (Example: In place or Delivery).
  - Any order can be payed with any method (Choose at least 3: Credit/Debit Card (This count as one), Applepay, Paypal, Cryptocurrencies).
  - Any method type must use any type of identification (Choose at least 2 for each one: DNI, MFA, email, SMS, fingerprint)
  
## Tips:
- Try to not ask me your doubts unless it is extremely necessary, google your issues or doubts.
- I don't need the whole implementation behind every method but at least try to simulate every one them.
- If you don't understand my earlier explanation try to Google the concepts you don't understand. Ex: "Python SOLID principles", "Composition over inheritance Python", etc. Try to use english to search it instead of spanish, you will find better results (:
- The limit time it's until 23:00 of today, tomorrow will review it together.
- Whoever has the best code I will deposit the money for a Esquite (or Elote en vaso) xD (It only applies to one person, if there are two people, the prize will be divided).
